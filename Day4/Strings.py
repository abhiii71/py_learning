#STRINGS

Text is a string data type. 
Any data type written as text is a string.
Any data under single, double or triple quote are strings. 
There are different string methods and built-in functions to deal with string data types.

#STRING FORMATTING
"""
# Old Style String Formatting (% Operator)
In Python there are many ways of formatting strings. 
In this section, we will cover some of them. 
The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), 
together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", 
special symbols like "%s", "%d", "%f", "%.number of digitsf".

%s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)
%d - Integers
%f - Floating point numbers
"%.number of digitsf" - Floating point numbers with fixed precision

#PYTHON String as Sequence of characters
"""
Python strings are sequences of characters, 
and share their basic methods of access with other Python ordered sequences of objects â€“ lists and tuples. 
The simplest way of extracting single characters from strings (and individual members from any sequence) is to unpack them into corresponding variables.

In programming counting starts from zero. 
Therefore the first letter of a string is at zero index and the last letter of a string is the length of a string minus one.

#count()
